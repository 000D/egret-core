Egret 2.5.1 Release Note
===============================


Updated on: October, 10th, 2015


Welcome to Egret!

## Overview

In Egret Engine 2.5, we unify the frameworks of game and APP. The new layout would be a core library with third-party libraries so that Egret Engine can flexibly meet the different needs from developing games and APPs. This unification will substantially cut developing cost and improve efficiency. Please find below a detailed description.
